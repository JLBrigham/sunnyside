## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

I have chosen this challenge as I am keen to show that I can build a contemporary looking sight following a design template. Also responsive web design is not something I know much about so I hope it will be a good opportunity to learn this.

#### Start of project planning

I have decided to use React to build the project. I made this decision as looking at the design file I can see that the features of it are quite repetitive so I thought this would work well with React's component based structure as I will be able to build components that can be reused.

I will build out the HTML of the project before adding any CSS or Javascript. Also as I am going to focus on the web layout before the mobile layout. I'm unsure if this is good practice but as I am new responsive design it seemed like the best option for me.

Plan of elements I will need:

Top Section-
-div to contain all elements- use backgound image provided
-div for header container, p to be used for different links
-h1 for 'we are creatives title'
-svg for arrow

First problem I ran into was using an image as a background, for some reason the full image wasn't showing, even though I'd styled the div to fit the whole page. I suspected this was something to do with the size of the image and the dimensions of the div. I fixed this by using background-size: cover.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Something I did in this projecy which I haven't done before was to deploy the project at the start of the project. This isn't something I had thought of doing before but makes sense to do so so that others can view my project more easily and the progress that I'm making. I chose to deploy it using Netlify as I have used it before and found it very easy to work with, more so than Github pages.

This is my first time using a Figma design file, I wanted to make use of this to make my project as accurate as possible. I have had to spend a bit of time at the start of the project just palying around with it and am hoping I will unserstand more how it works as I use it to work through the project.
